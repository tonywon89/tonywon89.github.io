            My name is Tony Won and I am a software developer. But I didn't start out that way.
            In fact, I spent most of my life pursuing a different career path: veterinary medicine.
            I even got into the top veterinary school at the time, Cornell University,
            and attended for two years (out of four) before I changed paths.
            Since then, I have never looked back, and couldn't be happier.

            I first discovered the joy of creating things through playing Minecraft,
            where I spent hours building grand castles and advanced mining mechanisms
            After that, I wanted to translate this new found passion into something more practical,
            so I spent a summer learning computer programming through various online courses,
            such as Codecademy and Standford's CS106A: Programming Methodology. I built an Android app (which I still have on my phone to this day).
            After that, there was Harvard's CS50: Intro to Computer Science.
            After doing Michael Hartl's "Ruby on Rails Tutorial", I built my first full-stack web application:
            <a href="http://salty-falls-6718.herokuapp.com/">WorkToRelax</a>. I have been hooked to coding since.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To turn coding into a career, I attended App Academy, a 1000-hour intensive web development course. It was an awesome experience! And now,
            I am aiming for a job at a company where I can not only contribute my knowledge, but also learn and grow as a developer.
